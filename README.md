# GIFLoad
An Open Source Garry's Mod Loading Screen

Ever want a loading screen where you can display random images or gifs? Look no further!
With GIFLoad you can easily do that! 

# Features

- Random images: upload images or gifs that will be displayed randomly to people connecting
- Random music: music you upload will be chosen at random to play to people connecting. No limit!
- Optional upload script: allow your community to upload their own images to the collection!
- Simple design: gets right to the point and doesn't over-complicate the look
- Change everything: background, music, logo and display.

# How-to

Drag and drop everything to the root of your web server. Delete the optional upload script if it is not needed. set `sv_loadingurl` to `http://yourwebsite.com/loadingscreen` 

If you want users to be able to upload stuff, simply use the `randomimg.html` file. This is simply provided as an example, 
use it if you want, but I'm not responsible for anything that happens with it.

# Configure

Upload your logo to `bg/logo.png`.

Upload any music to `music/`. **NOTE: MUSIC MUST BE IN `.ogg` FORMAT!**
